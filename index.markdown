Hello Users,

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the heartwarming messages I've received lately. I owe you a proper explanation, so here it is: last year, I made the tough decision to stop developing the YouTube Downloader app, so it's no longer available on this blog. This decision was inevitable, and primarily driven by personal reasons. Other than that, keeping up with the rapid changes in Android platforms and YouTube updates became increasingly challenging for me.

There won't be any new versions of YouTube Downloader in the future and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, I recommend trying out **NewPipe** as an excellent alternative. This open-source Android app is actively developed and it works really well. You can find it here on GitHub or directly on its website: [newpipe.net](https://newpipe.net/).

Thank you for your unwavering support and appreciation over the years. It's been an honor to have such loyal users. ❤️

Warm regards,   
Samuele
